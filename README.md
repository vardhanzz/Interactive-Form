<h1>Interactive-Form</h1>

<p>This React application handles user authentication with a unique requirement: the email and password must be identical for both account creation and login. It provides a simple interface for users to register or log in, redirecting them to the home page upon successful authentication. The app is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across various screen sizes.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User Registration and Login:</strong> The app allows users to create an account by entering their email and password. The email and password must match for both registration and login to enhance security. Upon successful login, users are redirected to the home page.</li>
  <li><strong>Email and Password Validation:</strong> A built-in validation feature ensures that the email and password entered by the user are identical. This rule applies during both account creation and login to maintain consistency and prevent errors.</li>
  <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The application is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring optimal usability on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The user interface dynamically adjusts to provide a seamless experience across different devices.</li>
  <li><strong>Intuitive User Interface:</strong> The application features a simple and clean interface with clear instructions and input fields. The form is easy to navigate, enhancing the user experience and reducing the chances of input errors.</li>
  <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Basic error handling has been implemented to notify users of invalid inputs (e.g., mismatched email and password) with appropriate error messages. This helps users correct their inputs promptly and reduces confusion during the authentication process.</li>
  <li><strong>Redirect on Successful Authentication:</strong> After successful login or registration, the user is automatically redirected to the home page, providing a seamless transition between the login process and the main application.</li>
</ul>
